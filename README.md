# Space Explorer

A retro arcade space shooter built with [Phaser 4](https://phaser.io), TypeScript, and Vite. Pilot a responsive ship through a **10-level campaign**, survive escalating hazards, defeat themed bosses, collect power-ups, and upgrade your ship between missions.

## Game overview

### Core loop

```text
Menu → Game → Planet Intermission → Game → ... → Victory
```

- Fight through enemy waves, hazards, and bosses
- Lose HP on hits, but continue the run while you still have remaining lives
- Respawn after death if lives remain
- Spend score as credits between levels to upgrade your ship
- Reach the end of the campaign to trigger the Victory flow

### Campaign roster

| Level | Name | Highlights | Boss |
|------:|------|------------|------|
| 1 | Solar Slipstream | high-contrast onboarding, rhythmic telegraphs | No |
| 2 | Prism Reef | visibility pressure + ambush timing | No |
| 3 | Magnetar Foundry | storm-and-gravity pressure, first wall | Arc Warden Khepri |
| 4 | Fracture Convoy | frontal lane control and convoy choke points | Marshal Bront |
| 5 | Cinder Vault | attrition gauntlet through ember hazards | Pyre Leviathan |
| 6 | Graveyard Lattice | collapsing salvage corridors | Reliquary Crown |
| 7 | Mirage Archive | deceptive calm, memory-fog ambushes | Archivist Shade |
| 8 | Halo Cartography | fast orbital pattern prediction | Orbital Cantor |
| 9 | Glass Rift Narrows | claustrophobic canyon precision flying | Rift Basilisk |
| 10 | Eventide Singularity | full-system anomaly finale | Axiom Null |

### Enemy roster

- **Scout** — fast, low-HP contact threat
- **Fighter** — mobile ranged pressure
- **Bomber** — slower, heavier target that drops bombs
- **Swarm** — fragile group attackers
- **Gunship** — heavier enemy with spread fire
- **Bosses** — named encounters with distinct styles such as barrage, pursuit, carrier, bulwark, and maelstrom patterns

### Gameplay systems

- **Scripted level sections** — pacing, hazard cadence, and encounter focus can shift inside a level
- **Hazard scripting** — asteroid bursts, ring crossfire, nebula ambushes, gravity wells, and canyon-wall rock corridors
- **Adaptive section pacing** — tension-arc shaping and fairness throttles smooth extreme overlap spikes
- **Adaptive boss scaling** — boss durability scales with player upgrade investment and campaign progression
- **Per-level procedural music** — each level and boss has its own Web Audio-driven music identity
- **Power-up drops** — temporary pickups such as health, shield, and rapid-fire boosts
- **Lives + respawn flow** — the run continues after death if lives remain
- **Upgrade progression** — intermission upgrades unlock over time and obey progression caps

### Upgrades

Bought during the planet intermission screen using score as currency:

- **Hull Armor** — raises max HP
- **Weapons** — increases damage
- **Fire Rate** — improves firing speed
- **Shield** — increases hit absorption

Some upgrades unlock later in the campaign and use progression caps so the run scales in a controlled way.

## Tech stack

- **Phaser 4** — game engine
- **TypeScript** — strict typing across gameplay and config
- **Vite 8** — dev server and production build
- **Bun** — package manager / script runner

## Design notes

- **Config-driven campaign** — levels, music, hazard sections, and bosses are authored through config
- **Procedural presentation** — visuals and audio avoid external asset-heavy pipelines where possible
- **Object pooling** — bullets, enemies, bombs, asteroids, and bullets are pooled for performance
- **Arcade readability first** — later levels add complexity through authored pacing and hazards, not only stat inflation

## Development

```bash
bun run dev      # start local dev server
bun test         # run unit/regression tests
bun run build    # type-check and production build
bun run preview  # preview production build
bun run lint     # eslint
bun run knip     # unused-code analysis
bun run levels:validate # config validation for level authoring
bun run bundle:report   # report dist asset sizes after a build
bun run bundle:check    # enforce bundle guardrail thresholds after a build
```
